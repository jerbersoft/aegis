# Aegis Implementation Backlog (v1 Bootstrap)

## 1) Purpose

This document combines implementation strategy, current bootstrap progress, and concrete implementation slices.

## 2) Backlog Rules

- Tasks should follow the documented module boundaries.
- `Universe` should be delivered before full `MarketData` implementation.
- Temporary bootstrap stubs are allowed only when they preserve the final architecture shape.
- Each task should be small enough to validate clearly.
- Acceptance criteria should focus on observable outcomes.

Status values used below:

- `complete`
- `partial`
- `next`
- `deferred`

### Delivery strategy

- Keep the implementation sequence aligned with the documented modular-monolith boundaries.
- Avoid circular dependencies between `Universe` and `MarketData` by depending on shared provider ports, not module-to-module references.
- Deliver the smallest usable operator slice first.
- Start with `Universe` and UI enablement before the full `MarketData` implementation.
- Use temporary development-safe stubs only when they preserve the final architecture shape.

### Backlog scope from the current state

- The current implemented inventory and verification history live in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- This document focuses on implementation sequencing, completed backlog items, and remaining work from that current state.

### Foundational contracts already in place

- `Universe` DTOs/requests/results
- `ISymbolReferenceProvider`
- `ValidateSymbolRequest`
- `ValidatedSymbolResult`
- shared watchlist-type enum
- shared API error shape

## 3) Phase 1 — Foundation and Solution Setup

- `src/Aegis.Web`
- initial test projects for `Universe`

Acceptance criteria:

- projects exist in the solution
- references follow documented boundaries
- `Aegis.Backend` is the composition root
- `Aegis.Universe` and adapter projects reference only `Aegis.Shared`

### Task 1.2 — Define initial shared contracts

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Create the minimum shared contracts needed for `Universe` and the UI.

Deliverables:

- common API error shape if shared centrally

Acceptance criteria:

- shared contracts compile cleanly
- contracts match documented `Universe` and provider boundaries

### Task 1.3 — Backend auth/session bootstrap

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Provide minimal v1 login/session support for `Aegis.Web`.

Deliverables:

- `POST /api/auth/login`

## 4) Phase 2 — Provider Bootstrap for Universe

### Task 2.1 — Implement `FakeSymbolReferenceProvider`

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Unblock first-time symbol introduction before the real provider integration is ready.

Deliverables:

- development-only `FakeSymbolReferenceProvider`
- canonical uppercase ticker normalization
- `is_valid = true` bootstrap behavior

Acceptance criteria:

- `Universe` can depend on the shared provider contract without depending on full `MarketData`
- the fake provider can be swapped later without changing `Universe` business logic

### Task 2.2 — Wire symbol reference provider into backend composition

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Make the fake provider available to `Universe` in development.

Deliverables:

- DI registration in `Aegis.Backend`
- environment-aware registration path if desired

Acceptance criteria:

- `Universe` add-symbol flow can resolve `ISymbolReferenceProvider`

- first-time symbol introduction using `ISymbolReferenceProvider`

Acceptance criteria:

- adding first-time symbol creates symbol record after provider-backed validation
- duplicate membership in same watchlist is rejected or handled idempotently
- removing symbol from normal watchlist works correctly

### Task 3.4 — Implement `Execution` removal guard flow

Status: `partial`

Goal:

- Enforce `Execution` safety rules.

Deliverables:

- blocker-check integration points

- open orders block removal
- unavailable blocker checks fail closed

Current note:

- the `Universe` side of the rule is implemented
- the concrete backend guard service is still a fake bootstrap implementation
- real cross-module blocker queries remain future work

### Task 3.5 — Implement assignment-detach coordination contract

Goal:

- Support valid `Execution` removal when assigned strategy is inactive.

Deliverables:

- coordinated removal workflow shape
- detach-assignment integration point/stub

- `docs/modules/UNIVERSE.md`
- `docs/modules/MARKET_DATA.md`

## 12) Dependency-ordered remaining implementation

Recommended next work in dependency order:

1. implement a real `ISymbolReferenceProvider`
   - this removes the current bootstrap fake and establishes the first real provider-backed adapter path without forcing full `MarketData` delivery first
2. start `MarketData` bootstrap
   - this is the main technical foundation for downstream strategy evaluation, live watchlist fields, readiness, and realtime behavior
3. decide and document the realtime `SignalR` path
   - the UI live-update path should be set before deeper market-data/UI coupling work begins
4. bootstrap `Strategies`
   - `Execution` semantics already depend on strategy assignment and active/inactive state ownership
5. bootstrap `Orders`
   - real `Execution` blocker checks need open-order ownership and query contracts
6. bootstrap `Portfolio`
   - real `Execution` blocker checks need open-position ownership and query contracts
7. replace the fake `Execution` removal guard service with real cross-module integration
   - do this only after the owning modules and contracts for blocker state exist
8. bootstrap the `IBKR` adapter
   - this should back `Orders` and `Portfolio` once those module boundaries are in place
9. bootstrap `Infrastructure`
   - connectivity health, pause/resume, alerts, and audit should be built around real module and adapter boundaries rather than ahead of them
10. deepen the UI beyond placeholders
   - dashboard data, live watchlist price/change fields, and deeper positions/orders workflows should follow the supporting backend modules

Current recommendation:

- do not start by replacing the fake `Execution` guard directly
- first establish the owning modules and contracts that the real guard must query
