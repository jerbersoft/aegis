# Aegis Implementation Backlog (v1 Bootstrap)

## 1) Purpose

This document combines implementation strategy, current bootstrap progress, and concrete implementation slices.

## 2) Backlog Rules

- Tasks should follow the documented module boundaries.
- `Universe` should be delivered before full `MarketData` implementation.
- Temporary bootstrap stubs are allowed only when they preserve the final architecture shape.
- Each task should be small enough to validate clearly.
- Acceptance criteria should focus on observable outcomes.

Status values used below:

- `complete`
- `partial`
- `next`
- `deferred`

### Delivery strategy

- Keep the implementation sequence aligned with the documented modular-monolith boundaries.
- Avoid circular dependencies between `Universe` and `MarketData` by depending on shared provider ports, not module-to-module references.
- Deliver the smallest usable operator slice first.
- Start with `Universe` and UI enablement before the full `MarketData` implementation.
- Use temporary development-safe stubs only when they preserve the final architecture shape.

### Backlog scope from the current state

- The current implemented inventory and verification history live in `docs/STATUS.md`.
- This document focuses on implementation sequencing, completed backlog items, and remaining work from that current state.

### Foundational contracts already in place

- `Universe` DTOs/requests/results
- `ISymbolReferenceProvider`
- `ValidateSymbolRequest`
- `ValidatedSymbolResult`
- shared watchlist-type enum

## 9) Phase 7 — Universe UI Integration Hardening

### Task 7.1 — Replace mock watchlist data with live backend data

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Connect the UI shell to real `Universe` APIs.

Acceptance criteria:

Status: `partial`

Goal:

- Handle backend validation and domain-state failures consistently.

Acceptance criteria:

- invalid symbol errors display clearly
- blocked `Execution` removals display properly
- symbol-reference-unavailable failures display clearly

Current note:

- current UI surfaces backend messages and blocker modal behavior
- Add Symbol now reopens cleanly after close, so stale invalid input and prior validation errors do not persist across reopen
- broader error normalization and hardening remain useful follow-up work

## 10) Phase 8 — MarketData Bootstrap After Universe

### Task 8.1 — Implement real `ISymbolReferenceProvider`

Status: `partial`

Goal:

- Replace the fake symbol-reference provider with a provider-backed implementation.

Acceptance criteria:

- first-time symbol introduction validates against the real provider
- `Universe` logic does not need to change when swapping from fake to real implementation

Detailed implementation plan:

#### Scope

In scope:

- implement a real Alpaca-backed `ISymbolReferenceProvider`
- register it in backend DI
- add provider configuration needed for symbol-reference validation
- preserve the existing shared contract shape if possible
- add deterministic tests for provider result mapping and failure normalization

Out of scope:

- full `MarketData` bootstrap
- realtime subscriptions
- historical bar ingestion
- `SignalR`
- execution-removal-guard replacement

#### Design constraints

- `Universe` must continue depending only on `ISymbolReferenceProvider`
- provider-specific SDK or HTTP response types must not cross the adapter boundary
- fail-closed behavior must be preserved for first-time symbol introduction
- existing `UniverseService` reason-code mapping should remain structurally intact

#### Planned provider-result mapping

- empty or whitespace-only symbol -> `invalid_symbol`
- unsupported asset class -> `unsupported_asset_class`
- known supported symbol -> valid result using provider-normalized identity
- unknown symbol -> `invalid_symbol`
- provider/auth/network/timeout failure -> `symbol_reference_unavailable`

#### Planned implementation steps

1. lock the symbol-validation semantics above as the adapter mapping contract
2. add strongly typed Alpaca symbol-reference options for credentials, environment, and timeout behavior
3. implement a real `AlpacaSymbolReferenceProvider` in `src/adapters/Aegis.Adapters.Alpaca/Services/`
4. update backend DI registration in `src/Aegis.Backend/Program.cs`
5. keep `UniverseService` using the shared provider interface without architecture-breaking changes
6. add adapter-focused tests for success, invalid symbol, unsupported asset class, and provider-unavailable paths
7. verify that `Universe` add-symbol behavior still produces the expected API outcomes

#### Likely files affected

- `src/adapters/Aegis.Adapters.Alpaca/Services/`
- `src/Aegis.Backend/Program.cs`
- backend configuration files for Alpaca settings if needed
- adapter-focused tests and possibly backend test host wiring

#### Validation plan

- automated tests remain deterministic and do not require live provider access
- one optional local smoke test may use real credentials for confirmation
- invalid symbol and provider-unavailable flows should still surface clearly through the existing API/UI path

#### Completion note

- this task should complete the first real provider-backed adapter path without pulling in broader `MarketData` responsibilities yet

Current note:

- a real Alpaca-backed provider implementation now exists in the adapter project
- backend DI now uses the real provider by default, with an explicit fake fallback switch for controlled test/bootstrap scenarios
- provider-result mapping is covered by deterministic unit tests and backend integration tests
- live verification has been completed through both direct API calls and the existing UI add-symbol flow under Aspire

### Task 8.2 — Start `MarketData` bootstrap

Status: `complete`

Goal:

- Begin `MarketData` implementation using the already-delivered `Universe` contracts and memberships.

Acceptance criteria:

- `MarketData` can read watchlist-driven symbol demand without requiring structural changes to `Universe`

Detailed implementation plan:

#### Recommended bootstrap target

The first `MarketData` slice should be a smallest-real foundation rather than a broad feature push.

Recommended slice:

- daily historical warmup bootstrap
- first-party `Aegis.MarketData` module
- `bar` persistence ownership in `MarketData`
- watchlist-driven symbol-demand derivation from `Universe`
- Alpaca-backed historical daily retrieval path
- simple readiness/status query path

#### Scope

In scope:

- create `src/modules/Aegis.MarketData`
- add MarketData EF Core persistence ownership
- add initial `bar` persistence model and generated migration
- add shared historical-provider contracts needed for the first slice
- implement Alpaca historical daily retrieval behind shared contracts
- derive daily warmup demand from `Universe` symbols/watchlists
- implement simple bootstrap readiness/status behavior
- expose at least one observable backend read/status path for verification

Out of scope for this first slice:

- full realtime websocket/streaming ingestion
- quote/trade ingestion
- live minute-bar revision handling
- full gap-repair engine
- full indicator engine
- `SignalR`
- scanner/trading readiness split
- full limited/full operating mode behavior

#### Design constraints

- `MarketData` must read `Universe` demand without taking ownership of watchlists or symbol membership rules
- provider SDK or HTTP payloads must remain inside adapter boundaries
- persistence ownership for bars must belong to `MarketData`
- bootstrap should start with daily-only historical behavior before intraday complexity
- the first slice should expose observable status/read behavior for direct verification

#### Recommended first persistence scope

Start with one logical `bar` persistence model owned by `MarketData`.

Recommended initial fields:

- `bar_id`
- `symbol`
- `interval`
- `bar_time_utc`
- `open`
- `high`
- `low`
- `close`
- `volume`
- `session_type`
- `market_date`
- `provider_name`
- `provider_feed`
- `runtime_state`
- `is_reconciled`
- `created_utc`
- `updated_utc`

#### Recommended implementation phases

1. create the `Aegis.MarketData` project and wire it into `Aegis.Backend`
2. add MarketData DbContext and generate the initial `bar` migration
3. add shared historical-bar/provider contracts required for this slice
4. implement an Alpaca historical daily provider behind the shared contract
5. derive daily warmup symbol demand from `Universe`
6. load persisted daily bars, detect missing initial history, fetch missing bars, and upsert them
7. compute simple bootstrap readiness/state for the warmed-up scope
8. add an observable backend read/status endpoint for validation

#### Recommended first acceptance boundary

Treat this slice as complete only when all are true:

- `Aegis.MarketData` exists and is wired into the backend
- MarketData owns its own EF Core persistence
- a generated initial migration exists for `bar` storage
- MarketData can derive warmup scope from current `Universe` state
- a historical provider can fetch normalized daily bars
- fetched daily bars are persisted and queryable
- a simple readiness/status path is available for verification

#### Recommended tests

Unit tests:

- historical-bar normalization mapping
- daily warmup demand derivation from `Universe`
- simple readiness-state behavior for warmup success/failure cases

Integration tests:

- MarketData persistence behavior
- historical provider result -> persistence flow
- backend endpoint returning warmup/status or bar-read results

#### Current recommendation

- do not begin with realtime or intraday runtime behavior
- establish daily historical warmup, persistence, and readiness foundations first
- use this slice to prove the module boundaries, persistence ownership, and provider contracts before adding live-stream complexity

Current note:

- `Aegis.MarketData` now exists and is wired into the backend
- MarketData owns bar persistence through its own DbContext and generated initial migration
- shared historical-bar provider contracts now exist in `Aegis.Shared`
- Alpaca historical daily retrieval is implemented behind the shared provider contract
- daily warmup demand is derived from `Universe`
- bootstrap status and daily-bar read endpoints are implemented
- the Home dashboard now includes a MarketData bootstrap widget for browser-level verification

- `docs/modules/UNIVERSE.md`
- `docs/modules/MARKET_DATA.md`

## 12) Dependency-ordered remaining implementation

Recommended next work in dependency order:

1. continue `MarketData` beyond the daily bootstrap foundation
   - the next MarketData work should extend into intraday scope, richer readiness, and runtime state on top of the now-implemented daily bootstrap base
2. decide and document the realtime `SignalR` path
   - the UI live-update path should be set before deeper market-data/UI coupling work begins
3. bootstrap `Strategies`
   - `Execution` semantics already depend on strategy assignment and active/inactive state ownership
4. bootstrap `Orders`
   - real `Execution` blocker checks need open-order ownership and query contracts
5. bootstrap `Portfolio`
   - real `Execution` blocker checks need open-position ownership and query contracts
6. replace the fake `Execution` removal guard service with real cross-module integration
   - do this only after the owning modules and contracts for blocker state exist
7. bootstrap the `IBKR` adapter
   - this should back `Orders` and `Portfolio` once those module boundaries are in place
8. bootstrap `Infrastructure`
   - connectivity health, pause/resume, alerts, and audit should be built around real module and adapter boundaries rather than ahead of them
9. deepen the UI beyond placeholders
   - dashboard data, live watchlist price/change fields, and deeper positions/orders workflows should follow the supporting backend modules

Current recommendation:

- do not start by replacing the fake `Execution` guard directly
- first establish the owning modules and contracts that the real guard must query
